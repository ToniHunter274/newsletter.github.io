## OVERVIEW

The project was pretty simple and intresting, perfect for beginner just with javaScript, the project tested my skill a little with the layout and also introduced me to the list-style-images and ultimaltely the javaScript exposed me form validation, regular expressions. Generally, it was fun all round.

### THE CHALLENGE

-Major challenge was the form validation.
-the interaction of the webpage when a wrong or no email is put.

### MY PROCESS

my process was the usual, HTML, CSS and javaScript. HTML5 semantics was introducted to the best of of abilities and CSS, just a bunch of classes, transitions was fun though. javaScript was were the magic actually happened, basically it involved creating a class already in CSS, and linking with javaScript with the term called "classList", so that was intresting.
